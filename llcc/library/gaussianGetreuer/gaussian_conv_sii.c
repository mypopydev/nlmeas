 * \brief Half-sample symmetric boundary extension
 * \param N     signal length
 * \param n     requested sample, possibly outside {0,...,`N`-1}
 * \return reflected sample in {0,...,`N`-1}
 *
 * This function is used for boundary handling. Suppose that `src` is an array
 * of length `N`, then `src[extension(N, n)]` evaluates the symmetric
 * extension of `src` at location `n`.
 *
 * Half-sample symmetric extension is implemented by the pseudocode
 \verbatim
 repeat
 if n < 0, reflect n over -1/2
 if n >= N, reflect n over N - 1/2
 until 0 <= n < N
 \endverbatim
 * The loop is necessary as some `n` require multiple reflections to bring
 * them into the domain {0,...,`N`-1}.
 *
 * This function is used by all of the Gaussian convolution algorithms
 * included in this work except for DCT-based convolution (where symmetric
 * boundary handling is performed implicitly by the transform). For FIR, box,
 * extended box, SII, and Deriche filtering, this function could be replaced
 * to apply some other boundary extension (e.g., periodic or constant
 * extrapolation) without any further changes. However, Alvarez-Mazorra and
 * Vliet-Young-Verbeek are hard-coded for symmetric extension on the right
 * boundary, and would require specific modification to change the handling
 * on the right boundary.
 *
 * \par A note on efficiency
 * This function is a computational bottleneck, as it is used within core
 * filtering loops. As a small optimization, we encourage inlining by defining
 * the function as `static`. We refrain from further optimization since this
 * is a pedagogical implementation, and code readability is more important.
 * Ideally, filtering routines should take advantage of algorithm-specific
 * properties such as exploiting sequential sample locations (to update the
 * extension cheaply) and samples that are provably in the interior (where
 * boundary checks may omitted be entirely).
